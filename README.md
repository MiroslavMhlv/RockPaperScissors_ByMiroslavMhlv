# [GAME] Rock Paper Scissors by MiroslavMhlv
This is my first repository on GitHub. It's a simple console game made by me in Java code.

In my version of this game you should enter an username to start the game.
The program saves your username in a variable named "username" which I use later in the scoreboard to display the current result versus the computer.
